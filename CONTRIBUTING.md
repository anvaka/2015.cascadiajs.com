# How to Contribute to CascadiaJS

## Read this document

CascadiaJS is a not-for-profit conference by web developers for web developers. It has been run by volunteers since its inception in 2012, but has never made it clear how people can participate and contribute to the experience. This document, influenced heavily by the open source software community, hopes to [document explicitly](https://medium.com/node-js-javascript/building-a-better-node-community-3f8f45b45cb5#eaf0-117692598f79) how someone can contribute to CascadiaJS. Please read this document in its entirety if you're thinking about getting involved. If you have any questions or concerns about this document, please file an issue and we will respond promptly.

## The Good, The Bad and The Ugly

Contributing to CascadiaJS (or any community conference) can be a truly rewarding experience. It is an opportunity to create a shared experience that brings hundreds of people together to share knowledge, get to know one another and have a great time. You will play a part in giving brilliant people who have never spoken before a platform to express their ideas to the world. Products, platforms and companies will spin out of the conversations over Whiskey.js that you help faciliate.

But it's not all roses. In fact, it's often hard, dull, detailed-oriented work that starts 6-9 months prior to the conference. The tip of the iceberg that you can see (the conference) barely hints at the total amount of person-hours that go in to making it happen. Take an honest assessment of the spare time you have. 

And finally, the very people you are working so hard for (the attendees) are often unappreciative of your hard work and sometimes downright mean. The people who get the most out of contributing to CascadiaJS are the kind of people for whom service to the community is its own reward.

## Roles and Ownership

Shared infrastructure that spans all 3 of these events will be taken care of: event space, ticketing, catering, Wi-Fi, etc. The responsibilities for the curator will be to build a team that can handle everything else and really breath life into each day.
