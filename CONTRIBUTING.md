# How to Contribute to CascadiaJS

## Read this document

CascadiaJS is a not-for-profit conference by web developers for web developers. It has been run by volunteers since its inception in 2012, but has never made it clear how people can participate and contribute to the experience. This document, influenced heavily by the open source software community, hopes to [document explicitly](https://medium.com/node-js-javascript/building-a-better-node-community-3f8f45b45cb5#eaf0-117692598f79) how someone can contribute to CascadiaJS. Please read this document in its entirety if you're thinking about getting involved. If you have any questions or concerns about this document, please file an issue and we will respond promptly.

## The Good, The Bad and The Ugly

Contributing to CascadiaJS (or any community conference) can be a truly rewarding experience. It is an opportunity to create a shared experience that brings hundreds of people together to share knowledge, get to know one another and have a great time. You will play a part in giving brilliant people who have never spoken before a platform to express their ideas to the world. Products, platforms and companies will spin out of the conversations over Whiskey.js that you help faciliate.

But it's not all roses. In fact, it's often hard, dull, detailed-oriented work that starts 6-9 months prior to the conference. The tip of the iceberg that you can see (the conference) barely hints at the total amount of person-hours that go in to making it happen. Take an honest assessment of the spare time you have. 

And finally, the very people you are working so hard for (the attendees) are often unappreciative of your hard work and sometimes downright mean. The people who get the most out of contributing to CascadiaJS are the kind of people for whom service to the community is its own reward.

## Roles and Ownership

If you'd like to contribute to CJS15, below is a list of roles that we could use some help with:

### Curator

This year's CascadiaJS is going to be different from year's past, we are going to curate [3 days of content](README.md#new-structure). Shared infrastructure that spans all 3 of these events will be taken care of: event space, ticketing, catering, Wi-Fi, etc. The responsibilities for the curator for individual days will be to build a small team that can handle everything else and really breath life into each day. It is a high stress, high reward role because at the end of the day you are responsible for the entire event.

### Website

Own the web content cradle to grave, including updates as tickets go on sale, speakers are announced, etc. You are responsible for the design of the site, shipping timely updates and fixing bugs.

### CFS/speakers

Manage the Call for Speakers and work aggressively to solicit submissions from a HIGHLY diverse group of people, where diversity includes but is not limited to: gender, race, geography, occupation and experience. Your responsibilities include: sourcing great submissions, building a committee to review submissions / select talks and taking care of the speakers during the conference.

## Join the conversation

There are several channels that the CascadiaJS community congregates, please feel free to join any/all of them and spend some time listening and getting to know people. To be honest, things are kind of quiet in between conferences. If you have any ideas on how to keep the conversation going, please let us know!

* [Gitter](https://gitter.im/cascadiajs/2015.cascadiajs.com)
* Twitter - @CascadiaJS or #CJS15
* IRC - #cascadiajs on irc.freenode.net

## Reporting bugs

Everything has bugs, including conferences. If you see something that you think should be fixed, please don't hesitate to file an [issue](https://github.com/cascadiajs/2015.cascadiajs.com/issues) or submit a PR. 

## Be willing to add to your toolbelt

A major factor that often keeps developers from contributing to open source projects is a lack of comfort with the tools and workflows that are typically employed. The most common stumbling blocks for newcomers tend to be

the command line
version control
local development
Depending on your background, these may be normal parts of your everyday workflow, or they may be intimidating obstacles that send you running in the opposite direction every time you scan a README. Before delving into a bit more detail about each of these and why it's important, here are some important things to keep in mind.

## Share your experiences 

If you’ve ever tried to debug a frustrating problem with a piece of software, you’ve probably gone to Google to find the answer. Google doesn’t know the answer, of course. It can only point you to web pages that others have created. That’s where you come in.

Write up something in your blog about how you’ve used the software, especially if it describes a problem you had and how you solved it. For example, I once spent a day debugging problems getting Solr to run under the Tomcat engine. After I’d pieced together the answer from many different sources, I created a single page that dealt with the problem for future Solr users to find. As you can see from the comments on the page, it seems to be working, and I take great satisfaction in that.

Writing up the story of your problem and solution adds to the body of knowledge of the project, even if it’s not part of the project’s official documentation.

## Be a good citizen 

Open source projects are small communities of like-minded individuals coming together over a common interest or skill set. As with any community, there are appropriate ways to conduct yourself when interacting with other members of that group. Treating others with respect is not just courteous, but it helps encourage new people that may have important contributions to feel comfortable enough to put themselves out there and take that first step toward getting involved.

Whether you're answering questions in a forum, chatting with someone at a conference or commenting on a section of someone's code, keep in mind that your words and your actions have real consequences. Treat others how you would like to be treated and keep in mind that we were all beginners at some point. When you encounter a community member that doesn't follow or understand the mores, just remember that someone once helped you and pass on the kindness.
