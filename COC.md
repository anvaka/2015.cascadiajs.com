# The CascadiaJS Code of Conduct

*tl;dr: Don’t be a jerk*

All organizers, attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at CascadiaJS are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting coorporation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

## The Quick Version

CascadiaJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.

## Reporting

If you feel uncomfortable, are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by [@TODO How are we identifying staff members].

You can also send a text message to [@TODO need a number that works for CAN and USA phones].

You can also send an email to [@TODO need an email address].

In case you can’t find a staff member, [Carter Rabasa](http://twitter.com/crtr0) is always there for you.

## Enforcement

Any participants that are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to do so immediately. If the behavior continues, you may be asked to leave the event.

brain dump from <http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports>

 * warning the harasser to cease their behaviour and that any further reports will result in sanctions
 * requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event
 * ending a talk that violates the policy early
 * not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy
 * not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the event
 * immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the harasser holds
 * requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future events your organization runs (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
 * requiring that the harasser refund any travel grants and similar they received (this would need to be a condition of the grant at the time of being awarded)
 * requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event and not return
 * banning the harasser from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
 * removing a harasser from membership of relevant organizations
 * publishing an account of the harassment and calling for the resignation of the harasser from their responsibilities (usually pursued by people without formal authority: may be called for if the harasser is the event leader, or refuses to stand aside from the conflict of interest, or similar, typically event staff have sufficient governing rights over their space that this isn't as useful)
