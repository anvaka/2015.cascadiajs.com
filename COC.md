# The CascadiaJS Code of Conduct

*tl;dr: Don’t be a jerk*

All organizers, attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at CascadiaJS are required to agree with the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooporation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

## Need Help?

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or report anything that makes you uncomfortable, you can use these channels:

Text: [@TODO need text number, make it a tel: link]  
Email: [@TODO need email address, make it a mailto:]  
In person: Any organizer [@TODO website, http: link]

## The Quick Version

CascadiaJS is dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable environment for all our particpants. We will not tolerate any inappropriate behavior, remarks, images, or online posts. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter, and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

Everyone, including attendees, sponsors, speakers, and organizers are expected to follow this Code of Conduct. Inappropriate behavior or harassment of any kind is not tolerated. 

Any offensive comments (or behavior, images, physical contact, and online media) related to the following is not appropriate.

* gender (including binary (male, female) or any non-binary gender alignment)
* sexual orientation
* sexual imagery
* disability
* physical appearance
* body size
* race
* religion
* deliberate intimidation
* stalking
* following [@TODO clarify]
* harassing photography or recording
* sustained disruption of talks or other events
* inappropriate physical contact
* unwelcome sexual attention
* anything that would make someone think, "Hm, that's inappropriate".

Sponsors and speakers should not use sexualized or inappropriate images, activities, or other material in their advertisements or talks. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Any participant asked to stop any harassing behavior is expected to comply immediately. We expect all participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues, as well as conference-related social events.

## Reporting

If you feel uncomfortable, are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by [@TODO How are we identifying staff members].

You can also send a text message to [@TODO need a number that works for CAN and USA phones]. or email to [@TODO need an email address].

In case you can’t find a staff member, [Carter Rabasa](http://twitter.com/crtr0) is always there for you.

## Enforcement

Any participants that are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to do so immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the the participant or expulsion from the conference with no refund, or being banned from any future CascadiaJS conferences or associated events.

Our foremost concerns in this case is the safety and comfort of all our particpants. We will evaluate any possible sanctions with regard to whether or not they provide the safety needed.
