## Report

Reported by *Janelle W*

### Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant doing the harassing

White male, wearing badge #12345

### The behavior that was in violation

Made offensive comments about women including saying that women are always late, and that they would now know anything about comics

### The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)

Approx 8:42 in the evening, during the welcome party.

### The circumstances surrounding the incident

Reporter came over to a group of men, several of whom she knows, to talk about something that she had seen they were working on that she also had interest in. One of the group then rebuked her for a) being late and b) only pretending to have interest in comics. Reporter felt unwelcome and uncomfortable.

### Other people involved in the incident

Other attendees, one wearing badge #31337 and another wearing a crazy tie-dye suit jacket.

## Other Side of the Story

### The behavior that was in violation

When informed that there had been a complaint about the comments, the male seemed nonchalant about the incident.

The male in question said that his comments were meant as a joke, and not intended to hurt anyone. He knows the reporter from other work they have done together in the past, and she "generally seemed ok with these comments". He also noted that nobody else seemed offended.

### The circumstances surrounding the incident

He was talking with a group of men he had been working with, and the women (whom he knows) came over. He was tired from working on the project for a long time, and frustrated by some of the functionality that he could not get to work properly.

## Our Response

Who is attending:

* Jeff A
* Sue R
* Brey H

Despite the man's claims, this is cleary offensive and unacceptable.

### Are we doing anything about it?

We have decided that a warning is sufficent. We will inform the man that his comments were not appropriate, and emphasize that he should not make similar comments in the future, or he will not be welcome back.

We will also mention to the community tomorrow that these kinds of comments are not acceptable, and we will apologize. We will tell the community now is a good time to review our code of conduct.

### who is doing those things?

* Jeff (talk to speaker)
* Brey (community)

### when are they doing them?

Talk to male tomorrow at breakfast, tell community tomorrow before talks begin
