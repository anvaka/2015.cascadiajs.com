Get your own hardware kit, like the latest Arduino Zero, and learn how to program the basics. You’ll be up and running in no time, using the Arduino IDE, the Particle.io cloud, and playing with fun add-ons from our all-in-one IoT kit. You get to keep the hardware and post your projects to Hackster so you can share it with your friends. See you at the workshop!
