![Sauce Labs](/assets/img/sponsors/SauceLabs/saucelabs-logo.svg)

We are excited to announce another awesome (and free) workshop!

* When: Friday, July 10 @ 2:15pm
* Instructor: Fil Maj featuring special guest Adam "admc" Christian
* Maximum capacity: 50
* Prerequisites: Android or iOS are the platforms we can work with, so coming prepared with SDKs and simulators/emulators/devices for each would make sense. Bonus points for installing and loading [appium](http://appium.io). Please clone this [repo of test scripts](github.com/filmaj/appium-test) as well.

Mobile devices are exploding and there is a higher and higher focus on delivering application experiences on non-desktop platforms. Most companies have no choice but to support a variety of mobile platforms, as well. Tooling for various mobile platforms is generally proprietary, cumbersome, slow, and in some cases, not free. In addition, there's high variability between devices: screen sizes, operating system versions, densities, sensors, capabilities. How can developers stay on top of all of this, while ensuring that apps built function the way we expect them to?

Testing is the answer. Manual testing can get you there, but why use your precious time to swipe here and tap there, when you can automate almost all of this away? Meet Appium, the Selenium-compatible automation server for iOS and Android. Learn how to automate testing your mobile, hybrid and native applications on these platforms, real devices or simulators, in this session.
