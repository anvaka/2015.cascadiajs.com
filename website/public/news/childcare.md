## Child Care at Semiahmoo Resort

We are excited to provide affordable child care for the very first time for parents and guardians attending CascadiaFest. Please read below for information on the provider, the costs and how to sign-up!

### Services

Child care is being provided by the wonderful people at [Bigtime Kid Care](http://www.bigtimekidcare.com/). Feel free to check out their website for more information about the care they provide and their child care professionals. Care will take place inside Semiahmoo Resort in a room dedicated to this purpose.

We will make sure enough care givers are on-hand to ensure the following child/caregiver ratios: 

* 0-1 years old = 2 children / caregiver
* 1-4 years old = 3 children / caregiver
* 4+ years old = 6 children / caregiver

### Price

Child care will be available every day of the conference (July 8-10) from 9am - 10pm. The day will be divided into two time slots, one during the day and one in the evening. Prices are below (per child, per day):

* 9am - 5pm = $30
* 5pm - 10pm = $20

For example, if you wanted to reserve child care for one child on Wednesday (9am - 5pm) and Thursday (9am - 10pm), the total cost would be $30 + $30 + $20 = $80.

### How to RSVP

If you would like to take sign-up for child care services at CascadiaFest, please email info@cascadiajs.com no later than **Friday, June 26th**. We will need the following information from you:

* Name and age of each child.
