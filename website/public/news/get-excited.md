![aw yeah](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJCfofLUcAAA6-X.jpg:large)

CascadiaFest 2015 is almost here! This year's location is amazing but will require you to trek to a distant corner of the Pacific Northwest.  But fear not! Read below for tips and tricks on packing for your journey and arriving safe and sound. 

## Are your bags packed?

The only required item to bring is a photo ID. But here are some things that we strongly encourage you to consider bringing. Remember, Semiahmoo is kind of remote and there isn't a 7-11 around the corner:

* Snacks - we will be serving 3 hearty meals every day, but if you need to nosh regularly throughout the day, please bring snacks.
* Clothes - sunny and 80's during the day, dipping to the low 60's at night.
* Pool gear - swimsuit, sunscreen, etc.

## Getting to Semiahmoo Resort

Semiahmoo Resort is located at [9565 Semiahmoo Parkway, Blaine, WA 98230](https://goo.gl/maps/IK8lS). Please reference the [CascadiaFest Travel Guide](http://2015.cascadiajs.com/travel/) on how to best make your way to the conference and home again safely. 

If you're interested in carpooling (either as a driver or rider) definitely [head to Gitter](https://gitter.im/cascadiajs/2015.cascadiajs.com) and let your fellow Cascadians know. 

### Note on Tuesday's Shuttles

We are arranging for shuttle service to pick people up from the Bellingham Amtrak and bring them either to the Bellingham Best Western or Semiahmoo. When you disembark from the train **please proceed directly outside and board the shuttle**. The shuttles will be departing on-time. More information on shuttle departure times in the [CascadiaFest Travel Guide](http://2015.cascadiajs.com/travel/).
