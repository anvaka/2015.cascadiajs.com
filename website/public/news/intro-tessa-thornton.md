Tessa is a self-taught front-end developer working at Shopify who spent 2014 having opinions about JavaScript frameworks. At Cascadia Fest: Browser Day, she'll tell us why our future with web component future is going to be OK. She has answered some questions for us:

*Is this your first trip to the Pacific Northwest? Do you have other plans for your trip?*
> First trip! I've barely been to the west coast at all, save from a short trip to Victoria BC last summer. After the conference I'm planning to head to Vancouver for the weekend to spend some time with a childhood friend. 

*What does your usual work day look like?*
> I usually bike into Shopify's downtown office around 9:30 and grab an iced coffee. The rest of the day is a combination of sifting through pull requests and issues, collaborating with designers on new projects, and building out libraries and utilities for the front-end team. 

*Who in the industry consistently blows you away with wonderful work?*
> I really appreciate developers who dedicate themselves to educating, whether it's through books or blog posts or conference talks. I have a lot of respect for Reginald Braithwaite, Kyle Simpson, Rebecca Murphy, and so many others that take the time to share their knowledge.

*Have you worked in industries other than the web?*
> I spent about 6 years working in food service before I graduated university, mostly as a waitress or barista. 

*What does your dream job look like?*
> Big challenges, good people, compelling product.

*Do you knit, play the banjo, make beer, climb rocks or do anything that isn't on a computer?*
> I used to knit a lot but lately I've been learning to sew! I also did recently start learning the ukelele, I have a background in music from my teenage years and I'm trying to ease my way back into it. 

*Is there anything else you'd like us to know about you?*
> I have a degree in Philosophy and Anthropology and for a while considered doing a masters thesis on indigenous experiences of public healthcare in Canada. Then I became a web developer instead.
