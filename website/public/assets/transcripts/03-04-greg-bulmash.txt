      >> So if you're taking a shuttle, I was going to tell you about the shuttle schedule.  The only shuttle goes to the Best Western.  They will leave absolutely on their scheduled time, and I know there are some early ones tomorrow.  And if you're like me, you may need to make a little bit administer effort to get there on time.  And the main reason for that is if you're taking a train, the train is not going to wait for you, so the shuttle is not going to wait for you.  Oh, a tip.  If you ask for a wake-up call from the hotel, that might help.
      And next up we have Greg Bulmash.  He's from Seattle, he also organizes --
      >> Yeah.
      >> Organizes Seattle coder dojo.  He's here to talk about kids, JavaScript, and Minecraft, which obviously kids like Batman, so I thought Batman onesie was appropriate.  Take it away.
      "Kids, JS, and Minecraft: A 'Dynamite' Combo."
      By: Greg Bulmash.
      >> Thank you.  So I special want to thank our organizers, Carter, Tracy, Ryan, and everybody who has been working hard on this.  My name is Greg Bulmash, my hobby is running Seattle coder dojo.  I put hobby in air quotes because it's a full-time job.  And Amazon gives us four classrooms on Saturday mornings and we teach about 80 to 100 kids on Saturdays.  I'm teaching Minecraft modding with JavaScript class there tomorrow.  This is a one-day no experience necessary class where we'll get kids introduced.  We did an earlier one in February and March that required more experience.
      Tickets sold out for this class in six minutes.  It's pretty popular with kids, and it's a great way to get kids interested in programming.  So before I go on, Katie told me that every deck needed a cat.  So I was thinking how do you relate cats and Minecraft?  And I was thinking the mine cat, and I missioned an artist to draw this.  So we'll be getting back to that in a bit.
      What is Minecraft?  For those of you who don't know, it's a game where you can either play in sort of a competitive mode where you're trying to survive and acquire assets and resources, or, you know, you can play cooperatively or you can just build the world's largest LEGO set with unlimited blocks and unlimbed colors.  And kids really do seem to enjoy it.
      As an example, the #Minecraft channel on YouTube has 9.7 million subscribers.  This is six times more than Justin Bieber.  And Justin Bieber has more than Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift, and the beetles combine.  So it's a pretty big following.
      Now, what is Minecraft modding?  Well, modding is writing programs within the game that use the game APIs.  And I'll show you an example.  This is a cow in Minecraft.  When you're modding, you can make them rain from the sky.  On fire.  Or if you want something less violent, you can stack them in a pyramid.  Now, people ask me how to set the cows stand still because they stand still.  Little trick in Minecraft, make the cow ride itself.  Very weird thing, but it makes them sell.
      So how do you do Minecraft molding?  Usually you have to download a server, it's built in Java, and most Minecraft modding is done in Java, but a number of people have built extensions that let you program in other languages like Python and now JavaScript.  So JavaScript in Java?  This is a thing.
      It actually started in the '90s when Netscape was building a version of Netscape Navigator that was in pure Java.  The navigator in Java didn't run on as JavaScript Mozilla project and Rhino, and six 2006, project Rhino has been distributed with the oracle job binaries.  So you can implement a JavaScript interpreter in Java right now.
      So why JavaScript?  Well, you know, you bring a bunch of kids in and go here we're going to teach you programming.  Book.  Complexity.  You don't want that lurking underneath the surface.  You want something simple.  So why JavaScript?  Let's compare the worlds.  The in-game world in Minecraft is 24 characters.  This is just a general demo world in Java.  You don't want to have to explain what public static void string is to a kid who has never programmed.  We can keep this out and maybe get to these kinds of concepts later when the kids are more -- a little more mature, a little bit more sophisticated.
      So the Minecraft plus JavaScript come bow was created by a game named Walter Higgins.  He's also associated with coder dojo, he's a coder dojo in Ireland who is doing modding with his son and heard about project Rhino and said, hey, how can I implement that as a mod to expose the Java APIs to JavaScript?  He did it over a Christmas vacation and then he's been working on it for the last couple of years and building in additional functionality and features.  It's really a lot of fun.
      So I'm going to give you a bunch of links.  So if you download the deck later, you can get to them.  We have, you know, obviously Minecraft the game and script craft, which is the mod that Walter created.  And then the mainors have given up maining it.  We have my Minecraft workshop docs at GITish dot Ninja.  And also Seattle coder dojo is doing a robotics day in a few weeks, and I would love some robots.
      Now, we're going to move to live demos because it's really fun to see this in effect.  So I'm just sort of going to tell you what I'm going to show you, and then I'm going to show you.  We're going to go through the JavaScript console that's in the game.  We're going to talk a little bit about the drone object.  We're going to blow some stuff up and then stack pigs in a pyramid.  So this is the end of the presentation.  We'll now bring up -- okay.  I forget we're on dual screen here.  So just a moment.  Where's my mouse?  I think it's -- there it is.  Okay.
      So we'll just move this over here.  And we'll maximize it.  And how about we just get out of the dual screen and duplicate so everybody's happy.
      All right.  So we'll get back into the game here, and we will turn our -- oh.  Turn on our sound.  Now, the great thing about Minecraft is it puts a JavaScript console right in the game.  So we can do -- and there's our hello, world.  Very simple.  Now, the great thing is that Walter Higgins, who built this, built a sort of like a jQUERY, a big helper library of features that you can do very simple stuff very easily.  So if I want to do a box of dynamite, we've got a box of dynamite.
      So you can literally show the kids how to build a world destroying brick of TNT in one line of code.  That gets their attention.  Another thing is that it's not so much world destroying as server crashing.  This we can blow up, it's not going to be too bad.  When you start going 20 by 20 by 20, now you've got 80,000 -- 8,000 before this accident of TNT.  It gets big.  So other than things you can do, and this is one of my favorite things he put in the drone is -- so we'll make a dance floor that's five blocks by five blocks.  You can build castles, you can build rainbows, so it's a great way you can get the kids used to using a function, passing a parameter, and they get immediate results, they're not actually having to write big programs yet.  But they can get a dance floor, they can get a fort, a castle, a rainbow, stuff like that.
      Now, of course I said we're going to blow stuff up, and that's all fun to do.  I'll walk away from the town.  Now --
      [Laughter]
      There are a couple of different things.  We can do just -- now, you saw that I did JS, now I'm doing JS P, you can make commands that players can use, those are called JS P, JS is your JavaScript interpreter.  So we're going to use a command called boom.
      [Loud bang]
      And that's actually pretty simple.  We'll get out of the game for a moment, and I'll show you the code.  And there's the code.  So boom is very simple.  We create a drone and move the drone away from us a little bit.  We're in creative mode, so we can't be killed so it's nice not to get thrown away.  And the reason I create the drone is because I don't have to do all the math to figure out where the new location is in 3D space.  I can just did get location.  And then an object within the location object is the world.  The world has a method make explosion, and you feed it the player who's calling it the location and the strength and boom.  You're good.
      And true is -- do you want smoke?  Because apparently explosions without smoke don't do a lot of damage.  Now, if you want to do something a bit more interesting, we can take a bigger boom, move it under ground just so I can fly away here because that's faster.  Take a bigger explosion, move it underground, and we'll just do.
      [Explosion]
      So as you can see I've happily named this big hole.  And then we can just sort of look down into it.  So you can make explosions like that.  The interesting thing about TNT.  You actually cannot, like, get -- you don't want to know what that's from.
      You can't get TNT's ID and blow it up.  You have to use the make explosion where you created the TNT.  And the TNT is created asynchronously.  So you actually have to set a listener for when the TNT brick drops.  That would be -- we do that with kaboom.  And who wants to see more explosion and pyramid?
      Okay.  The pyramid.  So we can do two things.  We can do just like a regular pyramid of cows and pigs, or we can do a pyramid of wolves, wait a few seconds for it to relax, and then a pyramid of sheep, rate weight for a few seconds for it to collapse, and see what the wolves do to the sheep.  All right.  I think it's wolves and sheep it is.
      So this is a simple -- this is another JSP.  And we tell to make it with wolves and there's our pyramid of wolves.  And they're riding themselves so that they will stay still and we've got a set time out that runs at about 12 seconds that will release them.
      [Wolves barking]
      So we'll just walk over here and we'll do the same thing.  And with sheep.  Now, while the sheep are there --
      [Growling]
      Yeah, so all the sheep are gone.  So that's my presentation.  You can find a copy of the server with these mods installed downloadable from GITish Ninja slash C along with some docs on how to install them.  I have those mine cat stickers in my pocket, if anyone wants them, just come and see me after.  And thank you very much.
