      >> That was awesome.  Is it okay if I talk a little bit?
      >> Yeah.
      >> So that was Jeff's first talk at a conference ever.
      [cheering and applause]
      >> I'm going to go throw up now.
      >> No, you're stuck here.  You can't go anywhere.  Sorry.  So earlier in the greenroom we were talking about, you know, cool things to do when you're in seeing a conference, and suggestion Tracy said, oh, I heard one time someone was, like, oh, what's your favorite -- who's your favorite Kardashian.  Jeff had a really answer.
      >> Well, the obvious answer is Kim.
      >> Right.  So I'm going to do a slight spin on that.  Which Kardashian for president?
      >> I think the obvious answer is Kim.
      [Laughter]
      >> I like you, Jeff.  You can just stay here all day if you want.  Will you help me read some of these awesome haikus that we got?  You guys are rad, the Internet is rad, that's why I make impersonate because the Internet is amazing.
      >> My site traffic dies watching the style sheets cascade like tears in the rain.  Oh, my god that's so good.
      I love blade runner so much.
      >> So good.  There are so many more.  You guys keep them coming.  I'm going to be reading these all day.  I might get them tattooed on my body somewhere at some point in time.  I'm going to leave out the ones that use cuss words, although those are beautiful too.  You can make art, no matter which way.
      >> Something is very strange here.  Layout is quite hard.  God, what have I done?
      That's like every day.
      >> These all end really sadly.  So, guys, CSS isn't that bad; right?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Maybe.  A couple more.  This one.
      >> Inline styles are eww.  OOCSS the best.  Please no bootstrap though.
      >> Okay.  I'll let you go now.  Can we have the music back?  I kind of liked that.  No?  Maybe.
      I love how this is all club music.  One thing not going to happen.  One thing I really love about the Seattle area is whenever I'm, like, listening to the -- do you guys still listening to the radio?  Is that something people still do?  Yeah, hey, cool it still exists out there, people.
      Whenever I'm in Seattle, one thing I really love is the radio always sounds like it's a DJ at a bar mitzvah or something.  It's the whole -- all the time it's the same five songs and it's these songs specifically.  Seattle likes to get amped up.  Maybe it's to keep us all from being miserable in the winter unclear.  I have a lot of love for this next speaker.  I could probably talk about it all day.  I'm just going to come stand by you.
      >> Yeah.
      >> While he figures this out.  So Amy and I were once coworkers.
      >> We were it was very awesome.
      >> Very awesome.
      >> She's an incredible creative director -- what do you go by?  What's your --
      >> Art director I think today.  I don't know.
      >> She does everything.  So, like, everything from, you know, conference swag to print stuff to posters to CSS and HTML, website stuff --
      >> I work with people a lot now, which is what I'm talking about today.
      >> Pretty exciting.  She works remotely from Portland.
      >> I do.
      >> Is that Portland.
      >> This week.  Cool.
      >> Are we good?
      "Remote and better for it."
      By: Amy Lynn Taylor
      >> I'm really excited to be here, thank you, Julie for that awesome introduction and thank you, organizers for just letting me be here.
      Sorry.  I think I'm really technically illiterate.  I think I hit the wrong button.  Sorry, guys, but now that you know I'm a real person that doesn't always get stuff right.
      Thank you I'm glad that's what we're clapping for.  Setting the bar pretty low today.
      Cool, hi, like I said I'm Amy, I'm really excited to be here, and I'm excited because I get to talk to you guys about something that I really care about.  One of the things that I love the most about the world that we work in today is that thanks to the Internet, many of us can do our jobs from anywhere.  But while the ability to work from anywhere is amazing, if you've done it for any length of time, that you know its got its downsides.  Remote work can be challenges, both for the remote worker and for the team.
      But if you can make it work, the payoffs are so huge.  You can -- that's me remote working in Italy a couple years ago.  It was pretty okay.
      So, yeah, if you can make a distributed team work, you can live wherever you want, you can travel whenever you want, and you can work with awesome people from all over the world.  That is my good-looking team.  Some of them are actually sitting in the front row here.  Just embarrass them because I'm embarrassed because I'm in front of all you guys.
      So, yeah, so I want to see the world be a better place for remote workers and for the teams that support them.  I'm going to talk a little bit today about what I've learned over the last four years as a remote worker worker, both as a personal experience and as a person who has had the privilege of helping build and shape what has become a really awesome distributed team that is committed to make remote work work.
      And so I'm going to go a little bit over my story.  I'm actually not going to go back this far, but I needed a kitten slide, and that's me in the middle.  So 1986.  That's good hair.
      All right.  So instead let's actually go back about five years ago.  The first few members of the team at that point were working together in a really tiny little office in Richland, Washington.  We were working in that office every day having a place, I loved that office.  I loved the people that I worked with, the work that we were doing was interesting and awesome, and I was crazy about the people that I got to do it with.  There was just one fatal flaw.  Even though &yet was basically my dream job, and it was located in my hometown.  A hometown which like any ambitious kind of misfit definitely clichéd young person, I found myself leaving.  I found myself at a crossroad.  Do I stay at this job that I love with these people who are awesome doing the stuff that I really enjoy?  Or do I follow my other dream and move to a big city?
      Wait a second.  What if I could do both?  Could we make that work?  And it was with that thought that the story of the distributed team began.
      About four years ago I moved to the city of Portland, Oregon, I'm sure there's a lot of people from there here today?  Thank you.  I knew it.
      Because Portlanders are everywhere, and we're awesome.  So, yeah, four years ago I moved to Portland, Oregon, leaving the office behind, shortly after a coworker moved to Idaho, and we officially began our journey as a distributed team.  It was tough.  I was really lonely.  I missed watching my coworkers playing weird pranks on each other.  I miss all of that kind of stuff, like, way more than I ever thought I would.  If I was working on a solar project, I would sometimes go days or even a full week without having any other real contact with any of my teammates.  Like, there were weeks where I would more interesting conversations with a barista, so sure we had team chat and the majority of the fun and even of the fun stuff was hostile happening offline.
      So the distance felt more than physical.  It felt like the remote workers and I were over here, and our team was over here, and we didn't know how to bridge that gap.  The pain and fear of missing out was very real for everybody on both sides.  Our positive team dynamic, though, but maintaining that positive vibe became a lot harder on a positive team and now across distances it was becoming increasingly challenging to just maintain it sense of togetherness.  And I felt I had found the perfect people to live work with who lived in the wrong timezones.  So how could we expand that experience to include all these people who couldn't physically make it into that office every day?
      We found ourselves asking questions, like, what is it that makes this place such a great place to work?  How can we replicate those things in a remote environment?  And how can we make sure that a coworker in Poland, Philadelphia, or Denver, feels just as important and included as the person in the next desk over?
      We had to take a hard look at how we did things across the team.  And we also had to ask ourselves why.
      The new team structure kept exposing a lot of flaws and how we did a lot of the interpersonal things on our team.
      See when your team is distributed, it really puts a lot of things about your team, like, your communication style, your project management style, your relational culture, it puts all of that stuff under a microscope.  Is going about having something spread out all over the Internet exposes any cracks and makes those things more apparent.  I feel like it's especially bad if you're spread out over multiple timezones, it makes it all so much more challenging.  But we were hell-bent on conquering these challenges.  And slowly but surely we got important information in more accessible places, getting the team together on calls and finding ways to get team players more connections with each other.  The more connections we were able to make for each other, the better things got, and not just for remote people.  For everybody.
      Now for you years later, more than one third of our 30 person team is remote spanning nine time zones and countries, and things are actually pretty great.  Knacked we've gotten so much better about making our office life remote, remote friendly that several people from our main office actually choose to work from home a couple of days a week.
      But all of this, it didn't happen overnight.  We logged a lot of hard work and a lot of long discussions, trials and errors and everything like that along this journey.  And nothing that we did or nothing that we do is revolutionary or extraordinary.  There's nothing magic about &yet.  Just like Disneyland isn't really magic.  It feels magical, but the experience is really just the result of a lot of careful planning and engineering decisions.  Like Disneyland, we work to create magical feeling experiences for each other.  There is no magic.  Anything magical that anyone has ever felt walking through the doors at &yet is a direct result of a lot of small, non-magical actions called choices.  And that is what I'm going to share with you today.
      Our small non-magical choices that add up to a big magical feeling workplace.  And that change can start now.  Actually one of the most important choices that you can make towards improving the happiness and health of your team, is just one that you can actually make right now.  I don't care what your title is or how long you've been at your current company, you are a leader.  Everyone in here, if you chose to show up to Cascadia today, you're a leader.
      And as a leader, you have to choose to make sure the health happiness, and positivity of your team a priority.  The impact on your coworkers because of a tremendous impact for good or bad.  If you continue to work on this, it will help everlasting everything else.  Your goals, productivity, everything will fall into place.  There's actually studies that show that.
      So we think that this is the most important choice that you can make.  Really choosing to make this a priority will actually help your team dynamic.  Building and maintaining an awesome team is everyone's job.  The people responsible for making all of these small, non-magical choices that lead to a positive workplace are not just CEOs, managers, or HR personnel, it's all of you.  It's everyone on the team who interacts with another worker on the team.
      So let's talk about some of the common problems that our teams face, especially remote teams and then we can talk about how to help those people.
      So communication is a struggle.  It can be hard to find the information that they need.  They often feel overlooked and like they don't have a voice.  They feel out of sync with the rest of the team.  The fear of missing out and the pain of missing out are real.  And if you're remote, you know what I'm talking about.  Like, it can be really hard sometimes if everyone at your main office is doing something really exciting and really fun, and you're, like, working from your couch or something and, you know, nothing cool is happening at your house.
      It can leave you feeling alone and forgotten.  The core problem, if you think about it, if you look closely, it's a lack of connections.  It all comes down to these much needed connections.
      Connection is why we're here.  It's what gives us purposes and meaning in these lives.  Those words are from Brown, and if you have not seen her TED talk, I suggest that you watch it this evening.  It's really great.  Yeah.  Thank you.
      So the more that we solved remote worker problems, the more we realized that they were potentially everybody's problems.  When it comes to remote versus non-remote workers, the line between us and them is actually a lot thinner than we thought.  In fact, it barrel exists.  Any struggles that you are facing with your remote team members are just connections of larger breakdowns on your team as a whole.  We all as individuals -- we are all individuals.  And if we don't actively seek to connect with people on our team, it doesn't matter how close or far we are physically.  Everybody is remote.
      Am your team might look like this on the outside.  It might a lot of people working together to make a really sweet pyramid on a lake, but your team's really made up of a bunch of these.  Your team is made up of small individual islands that are connected to each other.  Physical proximity can make us feel closer than we actually are.  This is a luxury of course that people, like, only in the main office have.
      But okay.  So imagine that this is a team.  If this was your team, like, it's not very connected.  Think about how much -- like the connections that your team has is essentially the strength of your team.  So if this is what your team looks like, if you're not very connected, there's all these holes, like, stuff's going to fall through the cracks, it's not very strong.  If you're super connected, you have this amazing Web that's going to catch stuff, it's -- you know, it's strong, it's secure, I don't know about you, but if I was jumping out of burning building, I would not.  The to jump into this team's arms, I would want to jump into this team; right?
      Proximity without connection is useless.  Being a team actually forces us to get better at a lot of the important practices that proximity had let us be lazy about out.
      And I'm about halfway through my talk, so I'm going to take a puppy break.  Okay.  You're not following the dog on Instagram, you're really missing out.
      So now that we're all happy, we've had some puppy time and some doughnut time, which is totally what I'm going to find after this.  Let's get back to it.
      Since most of these remote team problems stem from a lack of connection, let's talk about how we can make these connections happen for our teams.  The core things we've found extremely helpful as we've tried to improve our team dynamic are these.  Put people first.  Find and focus on the things that unite you, connect on a regular basis, have fun together, and this is a bonus step.  This isn't really a philosophy, but it's definitely pet peeve of mine.  Put everything important in a place where the whole team knows where to find it.
      So now that we've gone over those, let's dive a little bit deeper.  Put people first.  At &yet, we always like to say we're a people-first company.  One second.
      Your coworkers matter.  Your relationship with coworkers matters.  You spend 40 hours a week with these people.  You're working towards the same goals.  Like, who else in your life are you spending 40 hours a week with working toward the same goals?  These people are important.  We talk a lot about in life how work is not the most important thing.  I agree with that.  However, the people that you work with are different story.  People matter.  You cannot care about your job, but you can't not care about your coworkers with, that's not how life gets to work.
      This gives a tremendous amount of power in each other's lives.
      Projects, clients, and technologies, they'll all come and go.  Who you are as a group is what holds you together in times of uncertainty and strife.  As wonderful as &yet is, we've had our struggles.  We had someone once steal a ton of money from us, like, someone who we were really close to, we've lost clients, we've had projects fail so hard that our future was uncertain, but in all of the times that have been tough, the thing that has held us together even when you can just, like, see the look of fear on people's faces was that we know who we are as a team and we know what we stand for, we know what we value, and we know that we are committed to getting through stuff together.  And that leaves me to my next point.  Find and focus on the things that unite you.  If location doesn't unite with you be you really need to find and focus on the things that do.
      Share your values.  Share your goals.  Not just, like, your big team goals, but your personal goals and also your work goals should not only be project related.  Who are you working -- like what are you working towards as a team?  Who do you guys want to be together?  Figuring that out and proclaiming it and, like, writing it down and putting it somewhere where you can all look at it when you need to, that's such a powerful unifying tool.  Knowing who you are together is incredible unifying.
      Share your triumphs and your struggles.  Be vulnerable.  Something that we do that is our most vulnerable practice be we do deeper daily check-ins.  I think a lot of you are Pam with the concept of doing a daily check-in where you talk about what you've done with your day.  This is like that, we talk about what we've done, like, task-wise.  But we also go a little bit deeper.  We talk about things that are going on in our lives -- this is where people talk about, like, if they are sick and they have to get surgery or if they are excited because they just found out they're going to have a grandbaby.  Like, this is where a lot of, like, the life of our team actually happens is in these deeper daily check-ins.  It allows us to to share our triumphs and joys in a place and lift a hand if someone says, hey, I'm depressed, someone else can lift their hand and say me too.  It's really powerful.  It's probably one of the most powerful things we've done to unify our team as a remote team.  Because it let's us see everyone that we're working with even we can't interact with them, that we're all human.  It humanizes everyone on the team, and that's so important when you're trying to work through problems together.
      Communicate well with kindness and respect.  It's not just enough to communicate, but how you communicate matters.  Handle bad news with extreme care.  Prioritize conflict resolution, watch your tone.  Seriously edit your e-mails for tone, people tend to read things more negatively than you meant them when you write them.  So keep that in mind and edit for it.
      Have you guys heard of an account on Twitter calls faces and things?  If not I highly recommended checking it out.  It's @facepics if you need something of a distraction right now.
      So when we look at the human face, the facial recognition parts of our brains actually light up.  Like, who didn't look at that and did not see a smiley face; right?  In fact, they light up just like if you were seeing an actual human face making a similar expression.  This is a scientific phenomenon called pareidolia, and basically it's an excuse to use emoji in a professional setting.  So when you can't be there to show somebody how you feel, send one of these guys in its place.  It can soften a lot of blows, it can add a little bit more punch to some encouragement that you're trying to give somebody.  Use emoji, it's science.
      If I leave you with nothing else, I hope this is what you tall take from this talk, you can tweet at me, straight emoji, I will love that.  So now we've got all the heavier stuff out of the way and the scientific stuff out of the way.  Express your gratitude to each other.  Give high fives, real or virtual and often.
      Do it in team chat, do it on Twitter, if you're proud of one of your coworkers, like, my friend Jan Turner, oh, look, she's talking about me doing a talk at Cascadia, and here I'm doing it.  So any time one of your coworkers does something awesome, shout it from the rooftops.  It's so encouraging to know that people you're working with are supporting you.  So that I noticed, Jan, she's in the front row.
      Connect on a regular basis on more than just work.  Put it on your schedule.  If you don't schedule these connections, it's really hard to squeeze them in between all the deadlines and all of the projects.  One of the most powerful things that we have found for scheduling connection time is one on ones.  And we don't just do your standard managerial one on ones, we do peer to peer one on ones.  It's like managerial one on ones, but there's only two people on it, but they're not necessarily talking about work, at least not their priorities.  They talk about how stuffs going, they talk about what they're excited about it about.  They get to know somebody else on the team on a better, deeper level.  And a lot of this they get to find some of this crazy stuff in common.  And some of the cool ideas have come out of conversations that have happened on the peer to peer one on ones.  And this is a practice that I think is probably done, like, the most for us.
      Video chat your little hearts out.  This is Jenna.  She's also in the front run.  We video chat a lot at &yet now.  It's pretty incredible.  Just click through a few slides of us video chatting.  This is our design team hangout.  We video chat, we try to do as much as we can via video because it really -- it just really helps us feel connected.  It's kind of like that whole thing we're seeing faces, and we're connecting even though we're not in the same room.  Sometimes it feels like we're on a closed-circuit reality TV show.  We have cameras set up all over the office.  It's crazy.
      Create structures for spontaneous connections.  Show and tells, Friday updates, on going team chat, like, slack if you haven't used it.  We love it.  Have fun together.  Do cheesy ice breakers, we actually have a slack channel on our team that is just for ice breakers.  People post ridiculous questions and then people in the team answer them.  It's a lot of fun.  It's, like, a nice way that you can make some light-hearted connection with your team members.  Find ways for remote people to join in at the office.  Again, like I said we have a ton of cameras all over the place.  It -- we have them, like, in the break room, we have them in the kitchen area, anywhere that, like, people would just sit and hangout.  We have a camera Camry there so that remote people can call in and be, like, hey, guise.  Inside jokes.  They're awesome, team chat is a great place to start those.  We call ourselves Yetis.  Anything you can do to have your own vibe or jargon, we call ourselves Yetis and going back to emoji, if you guys think of this guy cute, I have stickers of him, so come talk to me afterwards.
      Do hangouts just to hangout.  Get together in real life.  The point is there's no magic that creates a great team.  There are just a lot of people waking up every day and choosing to work towards great things together.  How well do you know your teammates?  How could you create more meaningful connections with the people that you work with on your team?  Anything that we can do, you can do better.  You can probably come up with some ideas that would blow anything we've ever done out of the water.  I want to hear all about what works for your teams, I want to hear what you're wanting to try, you're all leaders, you're all creative, you're all completely capable of bringing magical feeling into your workplace.
      Be intentional, be creative, be creative, be kind, respectful, vulnerable, listen, and have fun.  Thank you.
      [clapping] 
      >> Amy for president. 
      >> They age really quickly.
      >> True, guys.
      >> Should we hang out for a second?
      >> Yeah.  We can do that.
      >> Is there beer in that cup?
      >> No.  I wish there was.  That would have done a lot for my heart rate.  It's just water.
      >> Well, you did great.
      >> Thanks, guys, that was my first talk ever.
      >> First talk ever.  Another first.  Actually all of our firsts this morning have been --
      >> Yeah.  All firsts.  We high-fived about it in the back room.
      >> Nice.  So a couple of questions.
      >> Okay.
      >> So Amy again is from -- living in Portland.
      >> Uh-huh.
      >> Where can one of us find the best cup of coffee in Portland?
      >> Oh, my gosh.  I feel like that's a really complicated question.
      [Laughter]
      Kind of political, a little bit weighted.  Man, if I was going to go somewhere this week, I would say this week because it changes a lot.  I would probably go to good coffee on division.  It's good coffee, like, the name says, but the design and the atmosphere is, like, just mind-blowing.  It's really beautiful.
      >> Design is important to you?
      >> It matters.  Like, a little bit.
      >> You do the drive from eastern Washington, Richland.
      >> Uh-huh.
      >> To Portland and back fairly often.
      >> Yes.
      >> How many times would you say that you drive through a year?
      >> At this point in my life, probably a couple dozen, like, closer to a dozen.  When I first actually moved to Portland because we were so terrible about all of the remote stuff and we weren't really a very remote team yet, I drove back every other week.  So I drove -- that's probably like 100 trips through the gorge a year, it's really beautiful though.
      >> Your poor car.
      >> I had to get a new one after that.  It was a Honda.
      >> It happens.  Honda.  Because you need a car.
      >> Yup.  Pretty much.  Every single time.  I'm on my third one.
      >> When you come to the office.
      >> Yes.
      >> Because I have been thereupon your rival.
      >> Yes.  Uh-huh.
      >> Sometimes you believe of the team a solid, and you bring new records, and it has a record player in the office.
      >> Oh, that's true.
      >> What's the most recent record you bought.  And there are still record stores in Portland; right?
      >> There are so many, if you want to buy vinyl, come, actually come to my house and take some of my husband's.  Gosh what record have I bought most recently?  I don't buy my records, my husband buys them for me, I believe the last one was a hearty record.
      >> Someone is really excited over there.
      >> Yes.  She's amazing if you haven't heard her.
      >> We're going to take a break.  Come get snacks,\.
      >> Stickers.
      >> Tweets some more haikus, and I'll see you after the break.
