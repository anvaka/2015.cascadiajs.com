      >> You did fine.  You did great.  Oh, he's coming back.  They always come back.  Let me give him sometime, give Ricardo sometime, I have some questions.
      >> No hurry, no hurry.
      >> No hurry.  So you are moving to San Francisco.
      >> Yes.
      >> The Pacific Northwest wants to know why.
      >> They want to know why.  I just started working for a company that's located in San Francisco.  It's called coflights and, yeah, that's basically the reason.
      >> Cool.
      >> And because San Francisco is awesome.
      >> Not as awesome as Oakland I will say.  Thank you.
      How did you get into fractals, I'm curious you said you like art, music.
      >> So what is amazing about fractals, it's just infinity and being able to play infinity is amazing, and I love being able to look at that.
      >> You have glasses, you like fractals, optics seem to be your thing.  That wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be.
      >> That's okay.
      >> So encouraging.  I love you guys.  You're so encouraging.  Okay.  Cool.  I have a request.
      >> Yes.
      >> Can you write me a haiku about fractals with CSS?  Not off the top of my head.  You can go away and do it.
      >> I could.
      >> Or you could do it right now.  I don't know.
      >> No.
      [Laughter]
      >> Cool.
      >> Let me just --
      >> Okay.  Thank you.
      >> Get my stuff together.
      >> Thank you.  Can we give him another round of applause?
      >> Thanks.
      >> Our next speaker has traveled from the far away land of Toronto, Canada where drake is from if you didn't know.  But more importantly, it's where Ricardo Vazquez is from, and today he's going to talk to us a little bit.  He's a designer and developer, he does both.  He designs and codes; right?
      >> Yes.
      >> He's an avid rower.
      >> Yes.
      >> I'm an avid eater, so, you know, we're so much alike.
      >> Pretty much the same person.
      >> I told that joke in the greenroom already.  Thanks for playing along.  You're a good sport.  All right.  So without further adieu, Ricardo Vazquez.
      "The Power of Emotion and Delight: Microinteractions."
      By: Ricardo Vazquez.
      >> Shanks so much.  I apologize to the cameraman.  So I want to talk to you today about the power of emotion and delight.  When I was a kid, I used to watch my grandfather play, and I was a kid, I was, like, nine, ten years old, I used to watch him, play, rehearse, over and over again, and sometimes he would play crazy hard pieces, and sometimes a pink panther theme song, which for me was perfect.  So regardless of the music, whenever I heard him play, whenever he played, he would end.  Put down his instrument.  A couple seconds would go.
      >> Truly I really did.  I was kind of scared.  Nowadays, though, I think what my grandfather used to say, was I paying attention to the microinteraction?  How one note led to another, how the very small nuances of music, was I paying attention to those?  I think I saw because I was feeling all these feelings whenever I listened to his music.  I felt delight, I felt surprise, I felt sadness of course, joy.  These are complex emotional feelings that we go through many of these in one day.
      So we will talk a little bit about those.  And it really turns out when I was feeling sad, happy, excited, you know, extremely confused about music, it's as if my brain was linking, so when we blink -- there's a study that came out of the University of Japan, participants were asked to do normal things; right?  Read a book, write and understand a sentence, watch an animated movie, touch a physical doll, and calculate a spatial mathematical function.  Now, I don't know how every day that is.  But the results are quite startling.  They found out that alpha and beta waves were being transmitted during the study.  That's completely normal.  You and I are transmitting alpha and beta waves right this second.
      What I'm showing you on the screen, however, those are feta waves.  The reasons why this is extremely amazing is feta waves up until that point they were mainly referred to as the dream wave.  These beta waves are present during dreams.  It's close to a aspirational experience.  So when we dream about flying, for example, feta waves are skyrocketing.  So in the study -- whoops.  Gave it away.
      In the study, researchers found out that participants, they were dreaming while they were awake, doing all these things.  Not just that, but they also learned better, you know, the stuff that they read and the movies that they watch, the menga, they were able to recall that far better.  The reason why is because an increase in feta waves also is a increase of catecholamines, which has vital for our brains, not just that, but of course third point, they remembered better.  And this one was a big one.  Why?  Why would they remember better?  Feta waves are cool, but why would they remember better?  And when judged why they remembered something better than others, people -- participants always said that it was because of an iteration for the details, the small things, how the doll physically felt in their hands or how the narrative of the story, moved them, shook them to their core.
      Those were all emotional experiences.  And it doesn't have to be, you know, everyday things.  Charles Emes, very famous, many, many years, created a Emes lounge chair, he often said the details are not the details because the details make the design.  And that's what these participants were all about, they were focusing on the details and that's why they remembered something better than other things.  They remembered them because of the details.
      Now, let's shift finally and talk about the Web.  The Web had quite a rocky start.  Yes.  So this is one of the very first Web pages available.  It consists of H1 and paragraph tags and a bunch of hyper links.  Not very emotional; right?  You would probably forget this quite easily.  Now, the reason why is because the Web was meant for academia.  It wasn't meant for us.  It wasn't meant for the complex emotional experiences that we put onto it every single day in the stuff had a we build, in the things that we design.
      So the Web had a rocky start.  And an emotional memory are very important principles for us to be able to remember things.  What -- what?  A wild unicorn appeared, that is extremely odd, who put that there?  Let's move on.  So recall, recall is very hard; right?  Right now you and I are conscious of last few words that we talked about.  What if I were to ask you what was the color of the slide before the unicorn appeared.  Before that.
      It was purple; right?  Yeah.  I will prove it to you.  Boom.  So -- oh, I'm sorry.  Man, blue, yeah, you won.  Color calibration, it's all right.
      Not many people can answer that actually.  Like, one out of every ten can answer that.  The reason why is our training of thought process is terrible.  Short-term memory is terrible.  Whenever something trains our thought, like a unicorn appearing, we forget everything.  So I might have just self sabotaged my presentation and all you could remember from this one talk might be just the unicorn.  But it does bare a purposes, and purposes that we need to improv our memory; right?  We need to get better at this.  Now, how can we improve memory?  How can we get someone to react better?  In theory it's quite easy.  We charge them with emotions.  We charge the experience full of emotions, like music, for example.
      And we remember lyrics that we heard 20 years ago today.  There's a concept in science call the emotional interphase.  As babies we cry and receive soothing in the form of a cuddle, can I say, blanket, we cry, and we receive something.  This transmission releases transmitters inside our body, all over our bodies that calms us down, and that is how we form this bond, this emotional interface connection between us as babies and our parents.
      Now, something similar could be said with a digital landscape, except that engagement is the one that will build trust.  If we add engagement and trust together, that will lead to a positive memory inside -- and what the experiences that we create every day.  It couldn't be more true for us.
      Every single one of you, whether it's your full-time job or side project or passion project or whatever it is you're building or designing or creating, you want it to be out in the world.  You want to share with someone, that's why we're here.  We do it because we want to share it forward.
      So let's take a look at what Donald Norman says.  He says attractive things make people feel good, which in turn makes them think more creatively.  Now, how does that make it easier for people to find solutions to the problems they encounter?
      What he really means by this is the conflict called esthetic effect.  Attractive things work better.  I'm not saying we should make everything absolutely beautiful.  No, there's something far more complex to that.  And that's micro-interactions.  In the past 15 years we've been tasked ourselves, let's take on big problems, what if we were to change that paradigm, however?  What if we were to say what is the smallest thing I can do that would affect the biggest meaningful change?
      The first that I remember and hopefully you do too.  No audio?  Is this audio?
      [Dial up noise]
      >> It's connecting.  So the first time I heard that was when I was nine years old I was connecting to a orange Mac, you know, those colorful Macs, and I was extremely excited because at the end of that sound, I was connected to the Internet, play games, I can't remember what I did at nine years old, but something amazing.  And that sound that you heard -- I mean it was there all the time.  But they surfaced that to the speakers of the computer so that a user could know that the line was busy, that something -- you know, the line dropped, that they were connected, that they were not connected.  That was a feedback mechanism, that was a interaction between a product and a human being.  So let's take a look at some of the principles that you can use today.  I'm going to talk you through five or six of them, hopefully you can find one and use it.
      The first we alluded to a little bit is visual polish.  Carefully crafted beautiful interphase.  Stunning, beautiful detail, beautiful stuff essentially.  This is lotsofdoughnuts.com.  It's made by a Canadian agency, they decided to do this because I honestly don't know why.  There's a blossom, we have a perspective of the doughnut, look of the insides of the doughnut, ingredients, and the background, though, you cannot see it, it's a very light shade of pink.  Over to the honey, a very, very famous one.  The background is yellow, nice illustration, again, nice insides, the reason why I'm showing you something so simple, is it doesn't have to be a complex interphase.  It can be small.  These people wanted to make a website about doughnuts, and they did, and they made it beautiful.
      When we were working here, we were working on a photo page, and this photo page had shortcuts, and we were sticklers to details.  So if you take a look at the F, you will find the finger bump underneath that that is very similar to the finger bump that you have in your keyboards right now.  We wanted you to see that us as designers we were careful about every decision we made.  DIY.org is another great example.  This is their membership page.  Full page background color, purple -- or bluish purple there.  Excellent I will excavations, the pizza, the stars, when the page loads up, the stars go down.  Look at the typography, look at the layout of it.  It is extra awesome.  It really truly is.
      Moving on to personality.  Now, man, personality is a big one.  We've all experienced a crazy emotional connection that we have with something that is completely inanimate; right?  Us as human beings, we actually thrive off of relationships.  We thrive off of a connection that we make with something.  So if there's something that has two eyes and smiles, whether it's real or not, we want to attach ourselves to it.  One example is the fox inside of most Mozilla products.  The fox inside of most months I will products, you know, for most people seeing a browser, essentially a Web page, a white page with nothing on it is boring and gives me nothing.  By adding a fox, it adds a bit more personality, it adds more brand presence, more interpersonal connection.  Another greater example, the one in the last seven or eight years, MailChimp.  Who doesn't know the chimp from MailChimp; right?  And hip monk, the reason why it's every time I travel is because of that dam chipmunk you see right now.  I swear.  Search for a flight, and you will find him exactly right.  He's sitting on his little -- and he's doing this.  It is the most adorable thing.  He's trying to fly.  I use it because of that.
      Okay.  Moving on to humor and microcopy.  This might be the one that you want to go for because humor microcopy are little snippets of text.  They can be helpful text, they're usually humorous, they blend the line between the obstruction and the suggestion.  Moving over to red pen, it teaches me how to say hello in different languages, now when we visit Switzerland, we'll know how to say hello, and I purchased something, been in my cart, and I received this e-mail that said, hey, Ricardo, you abandoned us essentially.  Maybe you saw how much shipping was and freaked out.  Maybe your browser crashed or maybe you had to save a child from the burning building.  Whatever the case was, they want my money.  Named me laugh with and I did give them my money.
      And sleep device tracks your sleep.  It says, hey, wow have you really not slept in seven days?  So this a little bit of Sass can be enough to bring the user back from an ignored state with a engaged state of product; right?  Again, MailChimp hits it out of the park.  If we create a user name ask the user name is taken.  It says, hey, maybe it's your evil twin.  This is extremely frustrating, I want my user name, it is my name after all; right?  But seeing this message relieves the frustration a little bit more.  Extremely helpful right here.
      This also extends to physical products.  Yes.  Yes.  Now you'll remember that.  Carbonmay.com, is a portfolio website, they ooze personality, it's one of my role models for my contractions.  Microcopy is one of them.  Through their packages.  Laser rail all caps on the right-hand side.  Yeah, you dig it.  You get it; right?
      And transitions is next.  Think of the flick of a light switch.  Feedback is really critical on the Internet, it can be animation, hover states, interactions, a whole talk can be devoted on purposeful transitions, so I'm just going to talk about one.  This is turntable.FM, it's a subscription website that you pay your own price.  The more you move the monkey on the right-hand side, the more that he became in love you with you.  So that was an experiment; right?  Hopefully spent a little bit more than $9 and pumped it up to 12 because of the monkey.
      And this is the last contraction principle.  Intelligently hidden little surprises throughout interfaces provide a layer of fun that ultimately delight our users.  Base camp.  At the footer of the website, enjoy the rest of your Saturday or have a happy Monday.  The console in Mozilla, it displays a Dart shooting flames.  And Google Maps is great of this, drag pin man over air 51, it becoming a UFO.  Try it.  It is amazing.
      And Google Maps is riddled with all these surprises.  It is why I use Google map.  And WWEUC earlier this year, this is at visual idiot posted this photo.  Swift constant with the value of medium, common made in the USA.  They could have just done a normal tag.  But why did they do this?  Because they were focusing on the small detail.  Base camp again.  This is their sign up page.  Their hand moves with the focused state.  If you do something wrong, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  This apparently converted, like, crazy good.
      He designed this, he's still going to blog about it, it was about a year ago, but he's still going to blog about it.  Where do we start?  And I've thought about this.  I actually didn't have an answer for this.  And what I realize is that build something you love.  When I think back to my grandfather and I watch him play over and over and over again, he loved music, he loved trombone, he loved to play it, and that was the battle.  The battle had been won.  All he had to do was continue improving upon his craft.  Continue improving upon his own practice and then my contractions just natural ooze out of it just like music.  If we play enough music, if we become passionate about it, then one note carefully and carelessly lends to another.  Piano becomes forte and you don't even know it.  You always start at zero though it happen does it work?  Does it not work.  Okay.  It doesn't work be I'm going to fix it, okay.  It works.  Ship it.  Done.
      No, let's not stop there.  Let's not stop at one it works.  Let's stop at okay.  It works and where's my smile?  Where's the smile I'm leaving to someone?  Where's the giggle?  Where's the surprise? where is your happiness?  Scour the Web, go to your favorite websites.  Pinpoint those micro-contractions, they are there.  They're seldom, but they are there.  Find what you love, the micro-contraction that you love, maybe it's purposeful transitions, maybe it is microcopy, find what you love and don't let it go.
      Donald Norman says the function that we understand is usable, but we build products that give joy, excitement, and even beauty into people's lives.  And that's what we're here for; right?  We're here to build beautiful things and share with others.  Thank you so much, guys.
      [clapping]
      Thank you.
      >> Speaking of fun and excitement, I'm back.
      >> Four minutes.
      >> That was amazing.  Yeah, shout out, he does amazing work be I can guilt him into -- you have to stay and hang out with me for a second, though.
      >> Yes.  No problem.
      >> Cool.  So we have one more talk before lunch, and just a few notes about lunch.  We are covering everyone's dietary concerns.  All of the food will be labeled.  If you don't see something that you can ingest or you feel uncomfortable eating, please approach one of the organizers, and they will make you something special in the kitchen.
