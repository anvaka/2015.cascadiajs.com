#Free Ideas

This directory contains "free ideas" to help you get started on your speaking proposal for Cascadia JS. Feel free to take one of these starter ideas, give it a good hard stare and punch it up a little, and then submit a talk to our CFP: [https://github.com/cascadiajs/2015.cascadiajs.com/blob/master/proposals/README.md]

Remember: "Great talks are about ideas + the person + execution." 

The talk selection committees may not choose any talks on these topics. Because these very ideas are free for all, the committees could expect a talk based on these free ideas to be among the most well defined proposals submitted.

##Why?

These ideas will help increase submissions to our conference by giving prospective speakers some starting ideas to riff on. Additionally, the entire Cascadia developer community can contribute rough drafts of talks they'd like to see attend.
