## CJSFEST CALL FOR PROPOSALS – THE DETAILS

This year at Cascadia, we've added a day of excitement and mixed it up a bit with a modified format. In the past CJS, was a 2-day, 1-track conference that covered the gamut of JavaScript. In 2015, we are going to break down the event into 3 distinct days:

* CSS Day
* Browser Day
* Server-side Day

The entire event is Cascadia JSFest and we're stoked you're considering contributing to the fun! 

We invite the CSS and JavaScript community to submit talks for CJSFest 2015 at the Semiahoo Resort in Washington. This Call for Proposals will close on March 15th. When you’re ready to submit a proposal and you've read the instructions below that include the required template, go [HERE](https://github.com/cascadiajs/2015.cascadiajs.com/issues).

Diversity of voices is important to our community, so please don't think that you need to be a programming celebrity in order to speak at CJSFest 2015. The deadline to submit a proposal is **March 15, 2014 11:59pm UTC-1200**. If it's still March 15th, no matter where you are in the world, you still have time!

You are free to submit (and even revise) proposals up until that date. Please follow the instructions below and help us spread the word!

### PERKS
If you're accepted as a speaker, the following items are taken care of by us:

* Travel
* Hotel accomodations
* a few surprises

### TOPICS
To get a feel for what we might be interested in hearing about, take a look at
the previous years, 2012, 2013 and 2014. We are looking for CSS and JavaScript topics--
technologies that interest CSS and JS nerds. A few ideas:
- ES6
- UX
- CSS tomfoolery
- security
- production setups(deployments, monitoring, etc.)
- the Makers community--visual art, hardware, robots, music
- server side JS shenanigans
- tooling
- civic hacking
- testing
- mobile web
- education and outreach in JS programming and community

We are framework agnostic. We also accept non-talk proposals such as moderated
discussions. You can indicate your format in the CfP submission.

### HOW TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL
*OPTION #1*  
First, make sure you're available to attend the conference. It will be held on July 8-10, 2015.
* Create a [GitHub account](github.com) if you don't have one already
* Copy the template from below. All fields are required.
* Then go [HERE](https://github.com/cascadiajs/2015.cascadiajs.com/issues) to paste the template, modify at will, and submit your proposal!(Don't worry, you can keep editing so turning that truck around isn't too bad if you forgot something)

*OPTION #2*  
Knowing that your talk proposal is going to get put under a microscope in public is daunting for a lot of people (especially those who have never spoken before). Try this alternative by following the below template format and sending it to [speak@cascadiajs.com](mailto:speak@cascadiajs.com)

**Copy this template:** *All fields are required*
```
#Title of Talk

* Name      : Jane Doe
* Location  : Cascadia, USA
* Email     : janedoe@alltheemails.com
* Twitter   : [@janedoe][url to twitter account]
* GitHub    : [janedoe][url to GitHub account]
* Website   : [jane.doe.com][url to personal site]

##The story you'd like to tell

[Presentation description goes here. Try to keep it under say, 500 words, but more than 140 characters]

##Speaker Bio

![](url to avatar image goes here)*avatar is required*

I'm an example bio. I'm a magical sloth that likes to crawl and climb through the forest and sit in the stream and I write code sometimes.
```
**Template ends before this line** *All fields are required*

* Format for avatar should be PNG, 256x256.
* When you're ready, submit! You can go back and edit!
* Wait patiently (and nicely) for us to get back to you. We will respond to everyone who submits a proposal even if it's just to say "You're awesome, but not this year".

### What should be in the proposal?
- Every proposal should have, at minimum, the following information:
- Your Name
- Your location(it helps us budget)
- Your contact info
- Presentation title
- Presentation description
- Your preferred image for the website (256x256)

If would be great if you could add in a short personal bio (50 words or less)
and other details like links to your blog, twitter account, open source
projects, company, or what have you, that's completely up to you. Whatever
floats your boat. Bios are nice! :) 

If you have any other artifacts that relate to your presentation, like slide decks,
code samples, videos, etc--link to them!

### What are we looking for?
We're looking for anything related to the open web, which includes: CSS, accessibility, UX, browser,
Node.js, io.js, Windows 8, Firefox OS, tooling, robots, you name it. Please, no vendor
pitches (i.e. How to Use Product X). A great talk should address issues that
developers struggle with, break down and explain complicated topics and cover
new ground in JS technology.  All the talks will be 30 minutes. We don't permit
Q&A following a talk.

### WE CAN HELP
Not everybody is a natural talent on stage. Not everybody can produce kick-ass
slide-decks. Not everybody is a live-demo-god. Not everybody knows they have
something great to talk about.

There are about a million reasons why you don’t consider yourself a speaker,
let alone at Cascadia. We are here to prove you wrong. If all you have is a
gut feeling that you should be on stage, we are here to reach out and help you
to develop or hone the skills you think you lack to deliver a great
presentation.  We are happy to brainstorm your interests to see if a great
topic is hiding.  We are happy to connect you with experienced speakers to help
prepare your submission.

We are happy to review and advise on how to produce a slide deck.  If you need
practice giving talks, get in touch, we can hook you up with local groups or
set up a stage for you and a bunch of friends in advance, so you can practice
in front of a friendly crowd.  Again, whatever else you might need, we’re here
to help.

Get in touch: [info@cascadiajs.com](mailto:info@cascadiajs.com) (just don’t use this to submit a proposal).
If you need more encouragement, check out the following:

- Tiffany Conroy, [We Are All Awesome](http://weareallaweso.me/) that tries to convince you to speak.
- Raquel Velez,  [Is Your Conference Proposal Good Enough?](http://rckbt.me/2014/01/conference-proposals/)
- Chris Williams, [An Addendum About Conference Proposals](http://blog.voodootikigod.com/an-addendum-about-conference-proposals/)

### THE SELECTION PROCESS
Submission closes March 15th. We will be convening the committee to select by April 8th and will aim for speakers knowing approximately 3 months prior to the conference. Our reviewers will be scanning along the way for those ambitious enough to submit proposals early so we can make suggestions to get to a successful talk acceptance. We will be applying labels for talks we think will fit well into a particular day but no talk is accepted until a confirmation email is received from the committee.

### MISC
We have a rad [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cascadiajs/2015.cascadiajs.com/blob/master/COC.md). Check it out! Everyone who participates in our conference agrees to the enforcement of our CoC, and includes our friends, speakers, staff, sponsors, and attendees.

If you have any questions about this process, need more information or need
assistance with travel and/or lodging, don't hesitate to reach out to us at
[info@cascadiajs.com](info@cascadiajs.com).
Thanks, The CascadiaJS Team
